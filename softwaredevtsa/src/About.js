        <p>Scholar.ai is an easy-to-use, simple website that utilizes machine learning to determine if the student is a high risk, medium risk, or low-risk dropout. Scholar.ai, using its advanced machine learning algorithm, gives school administrators the necessary data to help keep students in school. The data can then be used to work with parents that have children who have a higher probability of dropping out due to academic patterns and extraneous circumstances outside of school. These students can be given the proper and necessary resources to help them better succeed in school and reduce their likelihood of dropping out. </p>
